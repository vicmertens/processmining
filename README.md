Process Mining in R using the bupaR package

In this post there are two R markdown scripts showing what can be done with bupaR.

processmining.Rmd is analyzing an excel with registered events for a company using requisitions.
These are created and need to be approved before they can be converted into a purchase order.
In this example there are onlky timestamps for the completion of each activity.

processmining2.Rmd is analyzing production data which has start and completion time stamps.
In that case we can look at the duration of each step.

For both examples the input files as well as the resulting html markdown document are included in this post.
